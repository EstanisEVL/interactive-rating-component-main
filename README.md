## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript
- SASS/SCSS

### What I learned

In this challenge, I learned how to add and remove CSS classes using JavaScript, which allowed me to reduce the number of lines of code needed to print on screen the score chosen by the user.

### Continued development

I'd like to continue honing my CSS skills so I can better replicate the designs provided by Frontend Mentor. And also I'll keep looking to learn the best JavaScript practices to improve my code, making it clearer, more efficient and easier to read and understand.
